	  <h2>A language designed with beginners in mind.</h2>
	  <h3>Easy to read, write, and learn.</h3>
	  <h3>First developed at HackSB 2018</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="info">
	  <h2>Rationale</h2>
	  <p>
	  Lingua was built on three principles: that a language should be easy to read, 
	  easy to write, and easy to fix your mistakes in. Too many times, students get
	  frustrated or give up because they do not understand the complex, often esoteric
	  nature of many programming languages. After all, many modern languages were designed
	  with experienced developers in mind, not beginners. Lingua attempts to fill this void
	  by providing a language designed specifically with beginners in mind. With easy and
	  clean syntax that makes sense, and compiler errors that give helpful tips on how to fix
	  mistakes, Lingua is the best language for beginners to pick up and start learning right now.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Features</h2>
	  <p>
	  As of May 2019, Lingua is still very much a work-in-progress. While most of the syntax
	  and semantics parsing has been completed, the compiler itself has not been written.
