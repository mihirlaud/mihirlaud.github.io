    <h1>Robotics!</h1>
	<p>Starting in my sophomore year, I participated in my high school's VEX robotics club, which involved using the engineering design process to design, build, and program a robot to compete in tournaments against other schools. As a part of Team 750R, I programmed most of the robot's code and contributed to building whenever I could.</p>
