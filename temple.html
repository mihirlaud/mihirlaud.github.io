	  <h2>An educational math game that adapts to the student's skill level.</h2>
	  <h3>Designed to let children learn at their individual paces.</h3>
	  <h3>First developed at HackSB 2019</h3>

	<div class="info">
	  <h2>Rationale</h2>
	  <p>
	  Hidden Temple is an unique math game that uses an ELO-style ranking system to let
	  students learn at their own speed. Each student is given a ranking at the beginning which
	  increases every time the student answers correctly and decreases when the student makes
	  a mistake. The problems given are generated based off of the student's ranking; a higher
	  ranked student will get harder problems and more new concepts than a lower ranked student,
	  who will have their skills reinforced with easier problems. Through this adaptive mechanic,
	  Hidden Temple allows children to learn by themselves while still having fun.

	  Most of the mechanics of Hidden Temple are finished, however, the game still remains
	  unpolished. You can try out the beta version of Hidden Temple
