	  <p>
	  Each year, VEX Robotics puts out a different game to challenge the minds
	  and skills of high school students across the world. This year's VEX Robotics
	  competition, Turning Point, revolved around flipping caps and shooting flags 
	  to score points for your own alliance. For the 2018-2019 season, my team, 750R,
	  was composed of 9 high school students with a incredible passion for engineering
	  that allowed us to qualify for the VEX World Championships in Louisville, KY.

	  <h2>Competitive Role</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	  As the head programmer for 750R, I was tasked with writing the code that allowed
	  the robot to function both autonomously and with driver input. I used a variety of tools,
	  including VEX Coding Studio, the VEXcode IDE, and the PROS API developed by Purdue
	  Univeristy's VEX U team for both the V5 systems and the VEX ARM Microcontroller. 
	  </p>

	  <h2>Autonomous</h2>
	  
	  <video width="50%" height="300px" controls><source src="auton.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
	  
	  <p>
	  Each match of Turning Point begins with a 15 second autonomous period, during
	  which robots must score as many points without any driver input. Over the course
	  of the season, 750R developed eight separate autonomous protocols - 2 for each
	  starting tile, one that parked on the platform and one that did not. The idea behind
	  this was 'versatility:' we wanted to give ourselves the best possible position in
	  autonomous regardless of our alliance's or opponents' abilities. With eight possible
	  autonomous functions, we can consistently win autonomous bonus without worrying about
	  any of the other robots on the field.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Descore</h3>
	  
	  <iframe></iframe>
	  
	  <p>
	  A crucial part of our autonomous protocols is what the team likes to call 'descore.'
	  In mid-season, we realized that most teams with flag-side autons started off by scoring
	  the closest row of flags, and that a team that could descore those flags would be in a 
	  much better position to win autonomous bonus. Therefore, 750R created the 'descore auton,'
	  a far-side autonomous protocol that waits until the absolute last second to descore the
	  opponent's flags, thereby securing them in our favor. As far as we know, 750R was the first
	  team to implement such an idea successfully in New Jersey, with many others following suit.

	  <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
	  
	  <iframe></iframe>
	  
	  <p>
	  Besides matches, VEX tournaments also have what's called robot skills, which is a way for
	  teams to show their skills in driving and programming by scoring as many points as possible 
	  in 60 seconds without any other teams on the field. For this year, 750R developed an 18-point
	  programming skills path, giving the team the 2nd highest programming skills in New Jersey and
	  the 4th highest robot skills in New Jersey. This also allowed us to qualify for the World
	  Championships, as both 750R and 2616J had a robot skills of 42 but the deciding factor in who
	  progressed to the international stage was highest programming skills.

	  <h2>Outside of Competitions</h2>
	  
	  <h3>Website</h3>
	  <p>
	  As head programmer for 750R, I also took the initiative to create a website to
	  document the team's journey throughout the season. However, competitions took up most
	  of my time, and unfortunately, the website is not finished as of yet. Click 
	  <a href="https://mihirlaud.github.io/750r-robotics" target="_blank">here</a> to visit the
	  750R website.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Marketing</h3>
	  <p>
	  As head of marketing for the entire club, I lead a team of highly motivated students
	  to manage and maintain marketing and sponsorship relations for 750. The group regularly
	  holds calls and meetings to discuss plans for events, both upcoming and in the future.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Sponsorships</h3>
	  <p>
	  To finance the costly trip for the World Championships, the marketing team searched for
	  sponsors who were willing to join our community and support our teams in their STEM endeavors.
	  We were able to raise over $2000 in sponsor money, bringing the cost per student down by
	  over $100.
